# Pipeline for Area-Level Estimation of Wet Bulb Globe Temperature and Universal Thermal Climate Index

## Project Overview
R code is provided for all steps from data download to raster-level summation of hourly wet bulb globe temperature and universal thermal climate index (UTCI). R scripts are accompanied by batch scripts which can be applied to more efficiently and 'passively' download ERA5 data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store, aggregate 10+ input meteorological variables to WBGT and UTCI using the heatmetrics R package, and spatiotemporally aggregate the WBGT and UTCI to daily, county-level metrics for use in epidemiologic analyses. Comments throughout provide guidance on setting up required accounts, downloading additional data, and understanding potential pitfalls in the process.

The download of ERA5 data in this repository advances on the approach described in the ERA5 Daily Heat Aggregation repository (https://github.com/Climate-CAFE/era5-daily-heat-aggregation), and again uses the ecmwfr package to efficiently query hourly ERA5-Land and ERA5 hourly data on single pressure levels data. The heatmetrics R package is then used for the processing of the meteorological and land use variables to relevant metrics of heat stress. The heatmetrics package must be dowloaded for use of script 4 in this repository, it can be downloaded from Figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/software/heatmetrics_R_Package/19739965?file=36838296)
